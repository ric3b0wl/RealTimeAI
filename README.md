## Contents
### HW0 
- p1 - Pass five random images (from the internet) to **ResNet 101**
- p2 - Pass five random images containing horses (one and multiple houses) to **ResnetGen** network and analyze the outcomes.
- p3 - **Ptflops** is a great tool to calculate the computational complexity of algorithms (number of MACs, and model size).
- p4 - The **MobileNet v2** architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite to traditional residual models which use expanded representations in the input. 

### HW1
- p1 - Image tensor, use the **.mean()** method to get a sense of how bright the image is.
- p2 - w2 * t_u ** 2 + w1 * t_u + b.
- p3 - U = W5 * X5 + W4 * X4 + W3 * X3 + W2 * X2 + W1 * X1 + B
